Data delivery service written in NodeJs
## the idea
The main idea behind this project is to provide a API to get Data from Nodes on the cluster to use in the status page.

## How does it work
This API runs on the same host as a InfluxDB Database. Look at the Setup section to get installation instructions.

This project powers and is powered by the following services
1. [status_page][1]
2. [NodeAPI][2]
   
Read their Readme for installation instruction.

## Setup
**coming soon**
